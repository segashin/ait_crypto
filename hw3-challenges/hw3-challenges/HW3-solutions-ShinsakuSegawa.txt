Challenge-1: MD5x3 (3 points)
-------------------------------------------------------
The key: 0xfeed3ec0ffee


Briefly explain how you solved the challenge:

Applying RF function with all possible keys to the original message and encrypted message. Then look for a pair of identical strings. By this MITM attack, I found that the first 4 bytes and the last 4 bytes are 0xfeed and 0xffee respectively. To find the rest, I used brute force approach and found that it is 0x3ec0. By concatenating them altogether, the full key is acquired.


Attach, in a separate file, your attack script that performs your attack and prints out the discovered key.
