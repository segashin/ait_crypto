=======================================
Challenge-1: Happy Birthday! (2 points)
---------------------------------------
Attach in a zip file the following files:
- your attack script (attack.py) that performs your attack and prints the two message variants and their trhash values,
- msg1.txt containing the first (positive) message variant,
- msg2.txt containing the second (negative) message variant.

Steps of your solution (brief description that is just enough to reproduce your solution):
<describe here how you solved the challenge>

I made about a hundred variants of messages by changing the words. Then, for each of the variant, I added 1~1000 spaces after "Dear Mr. Jones," and looked if any pair produces the same hashed value.



=======================================
Challenge-2: XOR-MAC (2 points)
---------------------------------------
Your fake transaction record:
2020:02:27|11:23:38|21450|A74635|B29846|04002500

---------------------------------------
Steps of your solution (brief description that is just enough to reproduce your solution):
<describe here how you solved the challenge>
1. Split the transaction int three parts
fmsg1 :  b"2020:02:23|11:23"
fmsg2 :  b":38|21450|A74635"
fmsg3 :  b"|B29846|00002500

2. The 8th digints of fmsg1 and fmsg3 can be changed keeping the result of xor the same.
   Chaning 3->4, 0->4 works.
