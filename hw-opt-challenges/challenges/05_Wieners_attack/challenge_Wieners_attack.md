Wiener's attacks on RSA
=======================

Your friend asked you to help her decrypting an important file flag.crypt (you find it in your handout folder). The file was encrypted with RSA using the program textbookRSA.py (also in your handout folder). As you can see, the public key is saved in the file flag.crypt but your friend forgot the private key. The only thing she remembers is that she selected the key-pair such that decoding would be fast. 

Can you help her to recover the flag?

## Hint

Read the PDF file in your handout folder, it contains useful information for this challenge! You can also find a program decryptflag_skeleton.py in your folder that we started to write but didnâ€™t have time to complete...
