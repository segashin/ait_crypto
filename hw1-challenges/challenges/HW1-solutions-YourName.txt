Steps of the solution (brief description that is just enough to reproduce your method):

Pick a word which has a repetitive diagraphics. Use the 4square-help.pdf to guess the word.

Ex. "ne-ge-yw-yw-p" -> "yw" is highly likely to be "in"
    "yw-eo-no-uz-yw-vu-o" -> "indeterminate"
    "uq-zw-hp-pa-hp"  -> "troopships"

Guess the rest of the words.
